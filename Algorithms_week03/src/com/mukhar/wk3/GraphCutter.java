/**
 * Implementation of Karger's Min Cut Algorithm. (See
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger's_algorithm) Find the minimum cut of the
 * graph given by Edges E and Nodes V. The algorithm randomly picks an edge and
 * then combines the two nodes given by the edge. Edges between the two nodes
 * are removed. Edges between either of the two nodes and other nodes are
 * modified to go between the new combined node and the original other node.
 * When only two (super)nodes remain, the minimum cut is the number of edges
 * that remain. The value after a single run of the algorithm is probably not
 * the actual minimum cut. However the algorithm is run over many trials, and
 * the smallest result is tracked. After a large enough number of trials, the
 * algorithm should successfully find the true minimum cut. This code outputs
 * the minimum number of edges.<br>
 * 
 * The data file contains the adjacency list representation of a simple
 * undirected graph. There are 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. The first column
 * in the file represents the vertex label, and the particular row (other
 * entries except the first column) tells all the vertices that the vertex is
 * adjacent to. So for example, the 6th row might look like :<br>
 * "6  155 56  52  120 ......". <br>
 * This just means that the vertex with label 6 is adjacent to (i.e., shares an
 * edge with) the vertices with labels 155,56,52,120,......,etc.<br>
 * 
 * Each edge is listed twice. For example, given row 6 as above, row 155 might
 * look like<br>
 * "155 91 185 53 164 108 145 171 200 6 ......"<br>
 * Any row that begins with "#" is treated as a comment and is not processed.
